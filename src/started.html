<h1>Download script being prepared</h1>
<p>This could take a while if you have a lot of games.</p>

<p>If you don't see any games listed in the download script, make sure
you are logged in. Please visit <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/">https://store.steampowered.com/account/</a>
and log in, then press the extension button again to start</p>

<p>You can view the save files yourself at
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/remotestorage">https://store.steampowered.com/account/remotestorage</a>
</p>

<p>This extension does not use your login credentials, and does not
access your save files. You need to download the save files yourself
later.</p>

<p>You should have a quick look through the curl bash script to make
sure it doesn't have any misquoted commands</p>
